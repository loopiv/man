GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright (C) 2024 Terrell Credle
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

  Preamble

  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
  software and other kinds of works. The licenses for most software
  are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it.
  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee
  your freedom to share and change all versions of a program--to
  make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free
  Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of
  our software; it applies also to any other work released this way
  by its authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
  price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
  you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and
  charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code
  or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or
  use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do
  these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
  anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if
  you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
  gratis or for a fee, you must pass on the same freedoms to the
  recipients that you received. You must make sure that everyone else
  also receives or can get the source code. And you must show them
  these terms so they know their rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,
  and (2) use the copyright to enforce the license. 

  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
  individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
  proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent
  must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
  modification follow.

  TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

    "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

    "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other
    kinds of works, such as semiconductor mask designs.

    "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
    License. Each licensee is addressed as "you".

    "Distribution" means putting the Program on a medium from which
    people can get copies, and includes distribution in the form of
    executable code, source code, or other forms of material.

    "Conveying" means any form of propagation that enables other
    people to make or receive copies of the Program. The term
    "convey" is used in this sense in this License, and also in
    other contexts.

    "Propagate" means to make a copy of a work or make a copy of a
    work available to others.

    "Modified Version" of the Program means any work containing the
    Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications
    and/or translated into another language.

    "Reverse Engineering" means the process of analyzing the Program
    to determine its components or structure.

    "Source Code" means the preferred form of the Program for making
    modifications to it.

    "Object Code" means any non-source form of the Program.

    "System Libraries" means those parts of the Program that are
    designed to work together with the Program to produce an executable,
    and which are not included in the Program.

  1. Source Code.

    The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
    making modifications to it. The source code must be accompanied by
    instructions for how to obtain the source code from a repository or
    a public server, if it is not included in the distribution.

  2. Basic Permissions.

    You may copy, distribute and modify the Program as long as you
    follow the terms of this License. This means you must include a copy
    of this License with the Program, and include a copyright notice
    stating the original authors and the license terms. You may not use
    the Program for any commercial purposes unless you receive a
    commercial license.

  3. Copyleft.

    The modified versions of the Program must also be licensed under this
    License. You may not impose any further restrictions on the rights
    granted by this License. This means you must keep the Program free
    and open-source for everyone.

  4. Conveying Modified Versions.

    You may convey a modified version of the Program, under the terms of
    this License, provided that you include the same copyright notice and
    license terms, and that you distribute the modified version along with
    the source code. You must also ensure that the modified version
    complies with the conditions of this License.

  5. No Surrender of Rights.

    You may not surrender your rights to this License or the Program.
    You must keep the Program free and open-source, and you may not
    impose any additional restrictions on the rights granted by this
    License.

  6. Patents.

    You may not use this License to assert any patents on the Program or
    on any derivative works. If you assert a patent claim that conflicts
    with this License, you will lose your rights under this License.

  7. Termination.

    If you fail to comply with the terms of this License, your rights
    under this License will terminate automatically. However, you may
    reinstate your rights by correcting the violation and complying with
    the terms of this License.

  8. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

    You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
    use copies of the Program. However, if you modify the Program and
    distribute it, you must comply with the terms of this License.

  9. No Warranty.

    The Program is distributed without any warranty. You should have
    received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with the
    Program. If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

  10. Interpretations.

    If you have questions about the interpretation of this License, you
    should contact the Free Software Foundation.
